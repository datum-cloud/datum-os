# datum-ui

This is the Datum UI monorepo. This repo is intended to help our teams and developers speed up development while building sustainable and low carbon footprint user interfaces.

## What's inside?

This monorepo is run on [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and built using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/). It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: susUI docs repo https://docs.sus-ui.datum.net/

- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Stack

Our team using this stack for our Turborepo:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to bundle, dev, test, deploy and run apps
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type-checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) the React frame for the web
- [React](https://react.dev/) for creating user interfaces
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for client-side data fetching, caching, and de-deduping API requests
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) for headless accessibility-compliant components
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles without leaving TSX syntax

### Prerequisites

Datum suggests using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for its speed and versatility, however, Turborepo supports many of the common package managers such as `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

To install Bun run:

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
bun run build
```

### Develop

1. Copy the .env, this is in .gitignore so you do not have to worry about accidentally committing it.
   This hold example of environment configurations which you should review and potentially override depending on your needs.

   ```bash
   cp ./config/.env-example ./config/.env
   ```

1. To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

   ```
   bun install
   bun dev
   ```

Alternatively, you can run a single repo instead of all the repos with the filter argument:

For example to develop on the docs app only run:

```
bun dev --filter docs
```
